### Architecture
This project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and the Factory design pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns and enhance the maintainability of the codebase.

- **Model:** Represents the data and the business logic of the application. This includes MySQL queries and JDBC for database interactions.
- **View:** Represents the presentation layer, which includes JSP pages, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Controller:** Manages user input and interacts with the Model to process the data and update the View. This is implemented using Java Servlets.
- **Factory Pattern:** Utilized to create instances of different classes, promoting loose coupling and enhancing scalability.
